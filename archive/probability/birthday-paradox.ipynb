    "On average, how many people do we need together in a room to a have a higher than 50 percent chance that two of them share the same birthday.\n",

    "P(\\text{two people share a birthday}) = \\frac{1}{365} \\approx 0.00274\n",

    "With three people $\\{A, B, C\\}$, we can form three different pairs $(A, B)$, $(A, C)$ and $(C, B)$ and yet again we're looking at the probability of two people not sharing the same birthday which gives us the following product rule:\n",
