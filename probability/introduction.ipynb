    "# Introduction to probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability**: a number between 0 and 1 that measure how likely something is to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample space**: discrete set or continuous range that represents all the possible outcomes of an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event**: something that happens. Each event is a sample from the sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random variable**: a variable that takes on values from its sample space with a certain probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample space of a die roll is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When rolling a dice, an event can be $heads$ or $tails$ which gives us $P(X = heads) = P(X = tails) = 0.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probability of an event\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💚 For any event A $0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💚 For all events $A_i$ in the sample space. $\\sum\\limits_i P(A_i) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💚 The probability of an event $A$ not happening is $P(\\overline{A}) = P(A) - 1$. This is known as the $complement$ of $A$. Sometimes written as $P(\\neg A)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💚 Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be *mutually exclusive* if they can't both happen at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💙 Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be *independent* if their outcomes are completely unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💙 We write $P(A|B)$ the probability of an event $B$ given event $A$ has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The rules of probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum rule is concerned with the probability of more than one mutually exclusive event happening. **It tells us the probability of either event happening**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💙 For mutually exclusive events $A$ and $B$ then $P(\\text{A or b}) = P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💙 Given events $A$ and $B$, $P(A \\text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "However if $A$ and $B$ aren't mutually exclusive we have to substract the probability where $A$ and $B$ collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The product rule tells us about the probability of events $A$ and $B$ happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💙 Given $A$ and $B$ are independent events, $P(\\text{A and B}) = P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability of a person brown eyed female being struck by lightning is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(female, \\text{brown-eyed}, lightning) = P(female)P(\\text{brown-eyed})P(lightning) = 0.5(0.8)(0.00000082) = 0.00000033 = 0.000033\\%\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💜 Given an event $B$ dependent on $A$, $P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A|B)P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a bag of 10 marbles: 8 red and 2 blue. The probability of drawing a red marble that we keep, then another red marble is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(B|A)P(A) = \\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right) \\left(\\frac{8}{10}\\right) = 0.6222\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Total probability\n",
    " \n",
    "> 💜 For each disjoint region $B_i$ in the sample space such that $B_i$ s never overlap, $P(A) = \\sum\\limits_i P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a group of 1000 people composed of 800 womens and 200 men. Given that 0.5% of women are color-blind and 12% of men are. What's the probability that a random person from this set is color-blind?\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P(\\text{color-blind}) = P(\\text{color-blind}|\\text{woman})P(woman) + P(\\text{color-blind}|\\text{man})P(man)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Joint and marginal probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The *joint probability* of two variables, $P(X = x, Y = y)$ is the probability that the random variable $X$ will have the value $x$ at the same time that $Y$ is $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *marginal probability* is the probability of a subset of those conditions."
